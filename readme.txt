These are unfinished scripts that were part of bigger project in Tableau. 
The topic was: Analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in quantitative and geographical terms in Poland and visualization of data using Tableau software and R.
I made many vizzes, mostly in Tableau and some in R, then also look on integration with R in Tableau by Rserve library. 
I only needed part of scripts which Imade in R so they were in some chaotic files with code I needed at the moment. 
The version uploaded to github will be slowly updated and put together, so that the R version resembles what I created in the tableau.
In covid_analysis is a bit preparing, cleaning and vizzes. In script_for_tableau are codes that I transformed into tableau script to show the integration of both tools. 
Data are from: 
https://dane.gov.pl/pl/dataset/2582,statystyki-zakazen-i-zgonow-z-powodu-covid-19-z-uw - cases, deaths etc.
